**IMPORTANT: Follow this format exactly.**  
Keep notes short and skimmable, and update only your section. This keeps the handoff clean for the next dev.

## 📏 Dev Note Rules

1. **Keep it short**  
   - Use bullets or shorthand—no paragraphs.

2. **Only include what matters**  
   - What you worked on  
   - Any breaking changes  
   - New env vars  
   - Blockers  
   - What's still missing

3. **Use this format for your log:**

    ```
    Dev #[X] – [Your Name] – [Date]  
    + [Thing you added]  
    ~ [Thing you updated]  
    - [Thing you removed]  
    ENV: [Any new env var or setup note]  
    ⚠️ [Anything broken or confusing]  
    ```
