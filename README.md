## üßë‚Äçüíª Dev Logs

### Dev #1 ‚Äì Harry Roper ‚Äì 07/01/2025

I worked on the core idea of the app. In research document I put what chat gpt sugegsted as the best app idea to GTM quickly and also virality.

I liked the idea of using peoples data that exists already and tell them some interesting insights about their spotify / instagram account and then show them events that match. I came up with a UX flow similar to spotify: https://www.tldraw.com/f/CHqUlrmeJAca_WnkGJ-JH?d=v-748.-1288.5097.3361.G7faoxngNkEOJXLpYy9f-

Added:

- Style guide
- Login page demoing styleguide
- React app in javascript utilising tailwind, jsx
- Set up global design system based on components in styleguide page.
- Added cursor rules so whenever you make new components, it should be in the apps style.

- Created a supabase project (ask for invite) with profiles table already setup and email verification disabled.

Missing:

- Proper login
- Proper fetching of data
- Proper suggestion of events
- Basically the whole app flow lol i did the design please use it.
